#Phase 3 Project: Blackjack!

Players wager chips with each hand to bet against the house.
You can hit or stand depending on your initial hand.
If you manage to get a higher hand value than the house, you win your bet in chips!
If you're extra lucky and land a value of exactly 21 you get double your bet!

Aces adjust automatically from a value of 11 to 1 depending on if you bust.
